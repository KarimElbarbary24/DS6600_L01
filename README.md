# DS6600_L01
The reason I chose this license is because it allows modifiying, distributing, and selling the code for all uses but it restricts others from changing the license for the files the MPL license was originally applied to. Had I not supplied a license, I would have retained full copyright to the content of the repo by default meaning that others cannot legally modify, sell, or even copy the code without proper permission. 

The part confirming that .env won't be pushed: 

" # Environments

.venv
